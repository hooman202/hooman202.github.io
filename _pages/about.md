<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Kyoto University, where I am working on taking robots out of the laboratory and into the real world to improve human-robot interactions. My passion lies in designing algorithms and new robots that can bridge the communication gap between humans and robots. I've been fortunate to pursue this passion throughout my academic career. Prior to joining Kyoto University, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I completed my PhD in 2021 at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I was advised by Daniel Szafir. My dissertation research focused on understanding how robots can participate in conversational groups and how they can learn about the physical aspects of the people within the group. I'm excited to share my work and insights with you on this website, and I hope you find it informative and engaging!</p>
